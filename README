Purpose:

Combine directory path lists into a single directory path list.

This utility is intended to be used in UNIX or Linux shell scripts for logins,
configuration, makefiles, and thi like.  With a few changes it could be adapted
 for other operating systems such as Windows or VMS.

Synopsis:

	catpath [-d] [-f] [-b] [-s separator] [-x] path...

Options:

	-d  Allow duplicates.  By default, catpath will not include a directory in
        the output more than once.

	-f  Include a directory in the output even if it doesn't exist.  By default,
        if a directory name starts with '/', catpath will verify the directory's
        existence before includind it in the output.

	-h  Display a help message and then exit without doing anything.

	-s  Specify a separator character to be used to separate directory paths,
        both on input and on output.  It defaults to a colon (':').

	-x  If a directory path starts with a tilde ('~'), expand it into the
        user's home directory (as defined by the environmental variable $HOME).

catpath reads the non-option command line arguments and combines them into a single
path list, tidying them up along the way.

There are three reasons to use catpath instead of simple shell scripting to build directory
path lists:

1. catpath avoids duplications; i.e. it won't include any given directory path more than once
(this feature may be suppressed with the -d option).

2. If a directory path starts with the root directory, catpath will verify the existence of the
directory before including it in the list (this feature may be suppressed with the -f option).

3, catpath eliminates extra colons that sometimes sneak into manually built path lists.

It is possible to do these things with shell scripts, but cumbersome.  catpath makes it easy.
